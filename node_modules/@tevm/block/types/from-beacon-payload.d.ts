/**
 * Represents the JSON structure of an execution payload from the Beacon API
 *
 * This type uses snake_case property names as returned by the Beacon API,
 * as opposed to the camelCase used internally in Tevm. Used when fetching
 * execution payloads from a consensus layer client.
 *
 * @see https://ethereum.github.io/beacon-APIs/ for the Beacon API specification
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { BeaconPayloadJson, executionPayloadFromBeaconPayload } from '@tevm/block'
 *
 * // Fetch the payload from a Beacon API
 * async function getExecutionPayload(blockNumber: number) {
 *   const response = await fetch(
 *     `http://localhost:5052/eth/v2/beacon/blocks/${blockNumber}`
 *   )
 *   const data = await response.json()
 *
 *   // Extract and parse the execution payload
 *   const beaconPayload: BeaconPayloadJson = data.data.message.body.execution_payload
 *
 *   // Convert to Tevm's internal ExecutionPayload format
 *   return executionPayloadFromBeaconPayload(beaconPayload)
 * }
 * ```
